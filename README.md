## Calculator

Challenge made from : https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29

## Tools used

.HTML 5
.CSS 3
.Javascript (ES6+)

## Difficulties encountered

. Theme switching was a bit tricky to make, basically I use 3 CSS classes that was added on the global page html container on a click event listener.
See more about that in ./app/themes.js

. Saving key values into my script was a bit confusing but I finally take the html textContent and save it into each single key.
It is in my opinion the shorter way to do it without declaring one variable for each of the 15+ values of the calculator.
